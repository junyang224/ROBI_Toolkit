# ROBI_Toolkit
Python scripts to work on the ROBI dataset - a multi-view dataset for reflective objectsÂ in robotic bin-picking (available at: https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/robi).

# Requirements
Python >=3.5 \
opencv-python >= 3.1 \
numpy\
ruamel.yaml

# Code
read_scene_imgs.py: A script to load test images (with 6D camera poses and the ground truth 6D object poses).\
read_pattern_imgs.py: A script to load stereo pattern images and disparity maps.

# Ground Truth Depth Map
Please note that, we capture the ground truth depth map with only Ensenso camera (no Realsense data). For Scene 4, 5, 8, 9, each viewpoint image has the corresponding GT depth map (in "GT_Depth" folder). For Scene 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, the GT depth maps were captured only for a subset of viewpoints in Ensenso data folder: \
For Scene 1-3: \
DEPTH_view_71---DEPTH_view_87
For Scene 6-7: \
DEPTH_view_12---DEPTH_view_14, DEPTH_view_16, DEPTH_view_18, DEPTH_view_22, DEPTH_view_24---DEPTH_view_41
